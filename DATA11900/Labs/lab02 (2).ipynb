    "To do the same thing for the universe, we need to know the distance-from-Earth and speed-away-from-Earth of many celestial objects.  Using pictures taken by very accurate telescopes and a lot of physics, astronomers have been able to estimate both.  It turns out that *nearby supernovae* -- stars that have recently died and exploded -- are among the best sources of this data, because they are very easy to see.  This picture taken by the Hubble telescope shows an entire galaxy, with a single supernova - as bright by itself as billions of stars - at the bottom left.\n",
